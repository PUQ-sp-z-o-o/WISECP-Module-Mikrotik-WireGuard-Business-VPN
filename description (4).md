**The MikroTik WireGuard Business-VPN module is designed to offer a customizable Virtual Private Network service for business clients who possess the capability to independently manage their VPN accounts.**

**At its core, the module provides the end customer with a group of VPN account entries that the client can control. This includes the ability to add, remove, block, and perform port forwarding on these accounts. All accounts are situated within a unified network and share a common external IP address. Moreover, there is a feature that allows internal traffic to be routed among these accounts.**

**This innovative system empowers the end client to establish corporate private networks for their own customers. With the flexibility to manage VPN accounts and the added functionality of internal traffic forwarding, businesses can tailor their VPN service to meet the specific needs of their clientele.**
